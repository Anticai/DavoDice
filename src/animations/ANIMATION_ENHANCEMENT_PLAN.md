## Planned Enhancements for Future Releases

### 1. Advanced Animation Features
- Add interactive drag-based animations
- Add 3D perspective animations
- Implement morphing animations between shapes

## Implementation Guidelines

1. All new animations should be added to the enhancedAnimations.ts file
2. Use spring animations for physical movements
3. Use timing animations with custom easing for controlled effects
4. Always reset animation values before starting animations
5. Use callbacks to chain animations together
6. Provide cleanup in useEffect to avoid memory leaks
7. Use the useAnimationPerformance hook for automatic performance optimization
8. Adapt animation complexity based on device capabilities

## Animation Performance Guidelines

1. Always use the native driver when possible
2. Avoid animating layout properties (width, height, etc.)
3. Use transform and opacity when possible
4. Minimize the number of animated nodes
5. Use interpolation to derive multiple animated values from a single Animated.Value
6. Batch animations with InteractionManager when running many animations
7. Simplify animations on lower-end devices
8. Scale particle count based on performance level
9. Use simpler easing functions on lower performance devices

## New Animation Files
We've created several key files to support this enhancement:

1. **enhancedAnimations.ts** - Contains optimized versions of existing animation functions
2. **ParticleSystem.tsx** - Reusable component for particle effects
3. **OptimizedParticleSystem.tsx** - Performance-optimized version of the particle system
4. **DiceAnimationSample.tsx** - Provides a reference implementation of the enhanced animations
5. **NavigationTransition.tsx** - Reusable component for screen transitions
6. **TransitionExampleScreen.tsx** - Demonstration of different screen transitions
7. **useAccessibleAnimations.ts** - Hook for accessibility-aware animations
8. **useAnimationPerformance.ts** - Hook for performance-aware animations
9. **AnimationSettingsScreen.tsx** - Screen for customizing animation preferences
10. **PerformanceSettingsScreen.tsx** - Screen for adjusting animation quality settings
11. **ANIMATION_DOCUMENTATION.md** - Comprehensive documentation for the animation system
12. **AnimationTestingUtils.ts** - Utilities for testing animation performance
13. **AnimationTestingScreen.tsx** - Interactive screen for testing animations
